# GroceryApp
A simple MERN Application

## Objectives of this project:
1. Create a database to store grocery products info. And track price changes based on dates
2. Recreate actual grocery receipts
3. Create a dashboard of expense distribution per products categories (ex. Fresh Food/ Canned Meat/ Snacks ..)
4. Hopefully create intuitive analytics to provide insight on optimal expense strategy:
  a. Which store has cheaper prices based on category?
  b. Are there specific months that some products prove to have price hikes?
