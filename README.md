# GroceryApp
A simple MERN Application

## Objectives of this project:

- Create a database to store grocery products info. And track price changes based on dates
- Recreate actual grocery receipts
- Create a dashboard of expense distribution per products categories (ex. Fresh Food/ Canned Meat/ Snacks ..)
- Hopefully create intuitive analytics to provide insight on optimal expense strategy:
  - Which store has cheaper prices based on category?
  - Are there specific months that some products prove to have price hikes?
